Title: About

Hi, I'm [NightBlade](https://twitter.com/nightblade99). Currently, I'm an avid user of the Godot engine. You can find various Godot usage techniques, tips, and tricks here; as well as the occasional, non-Godot topic (game design, web development, etc.).

If you're interested in my games, you can check out [Deen Games](https://deengames.com).

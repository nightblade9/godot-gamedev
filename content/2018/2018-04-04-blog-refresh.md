Title: Blog Refresh
Date: 2018-04-04

After a few months of stagnation on the blogging/marketing side, we're finally back! We hope, inshaAllah (God willing) to publish regular (or at least semi-regular) updates to our blog and our [current maintainer's Twitter account](https://twitter.com/nightblade9).

Accordingly, we also ditched our old, homebrew-coded blog for something sleek and production-grade (built in [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/)) blog.

Enjoy, and as usual, hit us up on Twitter to let us know what you think.
